This document describes the processed datasets included in the package and how they were obtained. These files are cleaned, structured versions of the raw data stored in data_raw/. They are ready to be used inside the simulation tools for the homework.

1. weather_processed.csv

_Location_:
`src/champagneSADEZLAN/data/processed_data/weather_processed.csv`

_Source_:
`data_raw/weather_full.json` (raw OpenWeather API data)

_Generated by_:
`data_raw/data_transformation.py`

_Description_:
This dataset contains cleaned weather information for a selection of world capital cities.
Only variables relevant for the simulation model were retained:

| Column        | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `city`        | Name of the city (string)           |
| `temperature` | Air temperature in °C (float)       |
| `humidity`    | Relative humidity in % (float)      |
| `pressure`    | Atmospheric pressure in hPa (float) |

_Cleaning steps performed_:

Extracted "main" fields from the nested JSON structure.

Removed unused OpenWeather fields (wind, clouds, timestamps, etc.).

Converted any values stored in list format (e.g. [12.4]) into scalar floats.

Ensured consistent column names and numeric types.

Saved output as a flat CSV file.

_Usage:_
This dataset is used to build CityWeather objects, which in turn allow the computation of:

expected guest count using expected_lambda(),

simulation inputs for party attendance.
